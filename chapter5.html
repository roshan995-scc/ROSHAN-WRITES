                <h2>Chapter 5: The unsaid Goodbye </h2>
                <p>Months passed, and Naina’s letters stopped coming. Aarav feared the worst but didn’t want to believe it. He told himself she was just busy, that she would come back when the time was right. But deep down, he knew the truth. The distance had grown too great.

                    One rainy evening, as Aarav sat alone in their once vibrant home, the silence was broken by the sound of keys jingling outside the door. His heart raced—could it be Naina?
                    
                    The door opened, and there she stood. But this wasn’t the Naina he had known. She looked different—tired, distant, as if life had worn her down in ways he couldn’t understand. There was no excitement in her eyes, no warmth in her smile. They sat across from each other, words unspoken, the weight of their shared silence filling the room.
                    
                    “I’m not staying,” Naina finally said, her voice barely above a whisper. Aarav’s heart sank. He knew this moment would come, but nothing could prepare him for the finality of it.
                    
                    “I thought I could come back, that things would be the same,” Naina continued, tears welling up in her eyes. “But I’ve changed. The world has changed me.”
                    
                    Aarav’s voice trembled as he replied, “I waited. I thought… we could still make this work.”
                    
                    But they both knew it was over. The distance between them was no longer just physical; it was emotional, spiritual. The love they once shared had faded, like a sunset disappearing beneath the horizon, never to return.
