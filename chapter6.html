                <h2>Chapter 6: Different Paths</h2>
                <p>Naina left that night, and this time, Aarav knew it was for good. He watched her walk away, disappearing into the rain, the final image of her imprinted in his mind. He stood at the window, staring at the distant mountains, which now felt like the only companions he had.

                    Days turned into months, and Aarav tried to move on. He focused on his photography, but his heart was never in it. Every picture, every moment, reminded him of Naina—the woman who had once been his world, now just a distant memory under different skies.
                    
                    Climax: The Last Encounter
                    Years later, Aarav was at a gallery showcasing his latest work. His photographs had taken on a darker tone—moody skies, abandoned streets, lonely sunsets. As he wandered through the exhibit, lost in his thoughts, he spotted her. Naina stood across the room, looking at one of his photographs—a stormy sky, with a single ray of light breaking through.
                    
                    Their eyes met, and for a moment, it felt like no time had passed. They walked towards each other, the weight of their shared history heavy in the air.
                    
                    “Beautiful,” Naina said, pointing at the photograph. “It’s like you captured our story.”
                    
                    Aarav smiled sadly. “Maybe I did.”
                    
                    They stood in silence for a moment, looking at the photograph, both knowing that they had once been the light in each other’s lives, but now they were just two people standing under different skies, forever separated by time and distance.
