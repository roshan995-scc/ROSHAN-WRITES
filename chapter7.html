                <P>Naina left the gallery that night, and Aarav watched her go, just as he had years ago. But this time, there was no pain, no longing. Only acceptance. Their story had ended, not with a grand reunion, but with a quiet goodbye.

                    Aarav returned home to the empty house, now filled with shadows of the past. He sat by the window, looking out at the mountains, the same view he had shared with Naina so many times. The world had moved on, but a part of him still clung to the memories.
                    
                    As the night fell, Aarav realized that some loves are not meant to last. Some are fleeting, like a beautiful sunsetâ€”there for a moment, then gone, leaving only the memory of its warmth.
                    
                    And so, under different skies, their hearts remained forever apart.......
