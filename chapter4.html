                <h2>Chapter 4: Distant skies
                    </h2>
                <P>Naina, in her travels, felt the exhilaration of discovering new horizons. She painted the skies of Italy, the beaches of Greece, and the deserts of Morocco. Yet, amidst the beauty of her new world, a part of her missed the quiet moments with Aarav, their simple mornings together. But as she moved from one place to the next, the distance between them felt more natural. Aarav became a memory, someone she loved but couldn’t be with.

                    Aarav, on the other hand, was left behind in their shared world. His heart, still bound to Naina, grew heavier with each passing day. He tried to capture the skies as he used to, but the colors didn’t feel the same. Life without her felt hollow, as if his heart had been put on pause, waiting for her to return.
