                <h2>Chapter 2: Drift</h2>
                <p>Aarav started noticing Naina’s increasing distance. Her paintings became more abstract, more longing for something she couldn’t name. She would stare out the window, looking at the mountains as if they were calling her. Aarav felt a shift, a growing distance between them, but he didn’t know how to bridge it. He thought their love could keep them together.

                    One evening, Naina confessed her yearning to travel. She told Aarav about her need to see the world beyond their little city, to find inspiration in different skies, different lands. Aarav listened in silence, his heart heavy. He feared that if Naina left, she might never return the same.
                    
                    “I’ll come back,” Naina said with a smile, but Aarav knew deep down that this moment marked the beginning of their separation. He feared that this was the turning point from which their love would never recover.
