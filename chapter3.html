                <h2>Chapter 3: The Departure</h2>
                <p>The morning Naina left was bittersweet. She stood by the door, her bags packed, ready to chase her dreams. Aarav hugged her tight, holding on to the moment, to her warmth, her scent, trying to etch it into his memory. “I’ll be back soon,” she whispered.

                    As the door closed behind her, Aarav stood alone in their once vibrant home, now filled with an eerie silence. He looked at the paintings on the walls, her presence still lingering in every corner, but the emptiness was unmistakable. The days turned into weeks, and Aarav buried himself in his work, trying to fill the void, but it was no use. His heart ached for her.
                    
                    Naina’s letters came frequently at first. They were filled with stories of distant lands, bustling cities, and breathtaking sunsets. Aarav clung to every word, but slowly, the letters grew shorter and more distant, mirroring the emotional space between them.
