                <h2>Chapter 1: The First Meeting</h2>
                <p>In a small, bustling city nestled between mountains, Aarav and Naina first met by chance. Aarav, an introverted photographer, and Naina, a free-spirited artist, crossed paths at an art gallery. Naina’s vibrant painting of a sunrise caught Aarav’s eye, while Naina was intrigued by Aarav’s photographs capturing the same sunrise in a completely different light. Their connection was immediate, as if fate had drawn them to the same place, the same moment.

                    As they spent more time together, their relationship blossomed into a beautiful love story. They would sit on the rooftop, wrapped in blankets, watching the sky change colors at dawn and dusk, lost in conversations about life, dreams, and their place in the world. Naina would often talk about her dream of traveling far and wide, painting the skies of different cities. Aarav, in his quiet way, loved the stability they had, but he never spoke about it. He knew Naina’s heart was restless.
